# Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
#### 1. Like Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree, Prim's Algorithm is also a greedy Algorithm. 
#### 2. The Basic Idea is to Complete the Minimum Spanning Tree by maintaining, two disjoint sets. One representing the vertices we have taken into consideration and other which we havn't.
#### 3. At every step,
